# Nauttaja

Derived from the [allegedly Finnish word for helper](https://translate.google.se/?sl=fi&tl=en&text=auttaja&op=translate), nauttaja is a save management tool for [Noita](https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/). The primary purpose for this tool is to circumvent Noitas perma-death by backing up the game files and restoring them whenever needed.

Please do note that this is a hacked together mess and since it features automatic file deletion it can be potentially dangerous.

## Usage

After [installation](#installation), the tool requires a one-time setup. You need to supply it with Noitas root directory on your system. On Windows, this is typically located at `C:/Users/<username>/AppData/LocalLow/Nolla_Games_Noita`. Once you have the path, simply run the following command:
```
nauttaja set-noita-dir <path to Noitas root directory>
```
That's it! The tool is now fully configured.

### **Important!**

To ensure smooth operation, only run this tool when you are sure that no other programs are accessing Noitas files. Do not run the tool while Noita is running or Steam Cloud Sync is trying to save your progress.

### Commands

- **`nauttaja`**

    Running the tool without any arguments will print a helpful summary of all available commands.

- **`nauttaja save <name>`**

    This will create a new save with the specified name.

- **`nauttaja load <name>`**

    This will load the specified save by replacing whatever save is currently loaded. Since this is a potentially destructive operation the tool will first try and create a backup, located at `~/.nauttaja/backup`. The backup is deleted and replaced whenever `nauttaja load` is run again.

- **`nauttaja list`**

    This will list all available saves, sorted by time created.

- **`nauttaja open <noita|nauttaja>`**

    This will either open Noitas or nauttajas root directory in Windows explorer. Since this is dependent on Windows-specific functionality, this command will not work on other platforms.

There is currently no way of removing saves with the tool. If you want to manually delete saves, they are located at `~/.nauttaja/saves`.

## Installation

The easiest way to use this tool is to download a pre-built binary from the [releases-page](https://github.com/LimeEng/nauttaja/releases). Do note that Noita is only officially supported on Windows.

Another possibility, if [cargo and rust are installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), is to download and install the latest commit on master by running the following command:
```
cargo install --git https://github.com/LimeEng/nauttaja
```
